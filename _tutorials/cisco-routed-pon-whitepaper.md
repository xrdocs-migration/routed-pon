## Introduction

Passive Optical Network (PON) has been around for a long time now. Recently new business cases like video (8k, 12k), AR/VR, Enhanced Gaming, and Enterprise Services are driving the needs for broadband network transformation. To prepare for the future growth, industry is moving from 1G GPON to 10G XGS-PON. XGS-PON as defined by ITU-T G.9807.1, supports high speed 10G symmetrical data rates in both upstream and downstream directions. XGS-PON is becoming the popular choice of deployment for last mile and middle mile operators. As per the OMDIA report (https://omdia.tech.informa.com/om029859/pon-olt-vendor-landscape-report--2023), the PON equipment market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 11.5% from 2022 to 2028. This expected growth provides significant opportunities to existing PON OLT vendors and attracts new suppliers. This brings in new opportunities for the broadband service providers to establish a new network foundation to transform the rural communities and make reliable connectivity more accessible with Cisco solutions and expertise.
