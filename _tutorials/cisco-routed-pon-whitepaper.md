## Introduction

Since its development in mid 1990's, Passive Optical Network (PON) (put the cisco link of PON) has evolved a long way. In the initial deployments, Fiber to the home - FTTH was the dominating use case. Recently new business cases like video (8k, 12k), AR/VR, Enhanced Gaming, and Enterprise Services are driving the needs for broadband network transformation. To prepare for the future growth, industry is moving from 1G GPON to 10G XGS-PON. XGS-PON as defined by ITU-T G.9807.1, supports high speed 10G symmetrical data rates in both upstream and downstream directions. XGS-PON is becoming the popular choice of deployment for last mile and middle mile operators. Apart from subscriber needs, there are various broadband funding initiatives (https://www-author.cisco.com/content/en/us/solutions/service-provider/rural-broadband.html?wcmmode=disabled) taken by the governments worldwide to provide broadband access to the underserved communities. This brings in new opportunities for the BSPs to establish a new network foundation to transform the rural communities and make reliable connectivity more accessible with Cisco solutions and expertise. 

## Challenges of the current PON deployments

Traditional deployments have huge OLT (Optical line terminal) chassis terminating on the BSPs access or aggregation network. These chassis consumes extra space and power which increases the operational costs. The dedicated chassis operate within a closed software ecosystem resulting in vendor lockin. They also lag the support for pay-as-you grow model and hence the BSP's end up buying entrie line card. In some scenarios, the chassis remain underutilized as all the ports are not being used up. Upgrading the chassis to support higher speeds becomes and expensive affair for the operators. And finally they
