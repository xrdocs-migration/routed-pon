## Introduction

In our previous [blog post](https://xrdocs.io/routed-pon/tutorials/cisco-routed-pon-whitepaper/), we introduced the Cisco Routed PON solution, highlighting the challenges faced in current PON deployments and how Cisco’s approach addresses these issues. We also explored various government broadband initiatives and funding efforts designed to expand broadband access in underserved communities. Additionally, we provided an overview of the solution’s key components and high-level architecture.
