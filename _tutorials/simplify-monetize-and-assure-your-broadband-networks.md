## Introduction

In our previous [blog post](https://xrdocs.io/routed-pon/tutorials/cisco-routed-pon-whitepaper/), we introduced the Cisco Routed PON solution, highlighting the challenges faced in current PON deployments and how Cisco’s approach addresses these issues. We also explored various government broadband initiatives and funding efforts designed to expand broadband access in underserved communities. Additionally, we provided an overview of the solution’s key components and high-level architecture.


In this whitepaper, we will take a deeper look into the Cisco Routed PON solution. We will examine its architecture in detail and explore how it enables broadband providers to differentiate their offerings and unlock new monetization opportunities

## Drivers for Broadband Network Transformation

Before we delve deeper into the solution, let’s examine current subscriber trends and consider their implications from an operator’s perspective.

The shift towards the hybrid work model has increased the demand for additional bandwidth and necessitated enhancements to existing infrastructure to support next-generation applications and services. We are seeing a rise in emerging applications that enhance user experiences, such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the metaverse. Gaming is a booming industry that requires low latency and high bandwidth, further driving broadband needs. It's not just residential users; but small and medium businesses are also seeing increased broadband demand to enhance their business models and provide new experiences for their end customers. These evolving subscriber demands, whether from home or business users, are challenging operators to innovate and upgrade their broadband networks.

How do these subscriber trends impact operators? In recent years, we have witnessed an unprecedented surge in data consumption—a trend that is only expected to accelerate with the growing adoption of AI technologies. Simply adding more bandwidth is not a sufficient solution. Instead, operators must select the right solutions and architectural upgrades to their networks in order to effectively meet the evolving and increasing demands of their customers.
